# The-Perfect-Dap
Dapping up your homie as a lego


The Perfect Dap symbolizes the strength of friendship and the stories and adventures experienced within video games. Incorporating Lego and Minecraft elements directly reflects the artists' influences and the broader youth culture's aspirations toward engineering and general creative outlets.

The piece requires at least two users to interact, each pressing a button. When both buttons are pressed, the two figures (chosen to represent each artist) rotate on a servo, with their hands reaching out to each other. This interaction produces a dap sound from the speaker, emphasizing connection and collaboration.
